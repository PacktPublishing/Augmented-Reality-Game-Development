## About the Book
The heyday of location-based augmented reality games is upon us. They have been around for a few years, but the release of Pok√©mon Go was a gamechanger that catalyzed the market and led to a massive surge in demand. Now is the time for novice and experienced developers alike to turn their good ideas into augmented reality (AR) mobile games and meet this demand!

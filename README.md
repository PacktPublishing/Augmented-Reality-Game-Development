#Augmented Reality Game Development
This is the code repository for [Augmented Reality Game Development](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/augmented-reality-game-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787122888), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The heyday of location-based augmented reality games is upon us. They have been around for a few years, but the release of Pok√©mon Go was a gamechanger that catalyzed the market and led to a massive surge in demand. Now is the time for novice and experienced developers alike to turn their good ideas into augmented reality (AR) mobile games and meet this demand!


##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
#import packages into the project
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from urllib.request import urlopen
import pandas as pd
```
